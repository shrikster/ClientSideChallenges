Instructions:

· Web page that clicking 'start' will perform Ajax requests one after the other (sequentially)
· Update on the progress on screen at the end submit all results (which operation succeeded and which failed) via Ajax.
· The requests can be user_index (0 to 100) and the response tells whether he is online or not. 
· Make the server side to return random 50/50% to be online or not.
·The Ajax server can be written in a language of your choice, though if you know Node.js, it would be better.
